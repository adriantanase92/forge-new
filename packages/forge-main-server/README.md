# Best Practices for File and Folder Structure

## Modular Structure:

-   **src/**
    -   **controllers/**: Business logic for handling specific routes.
    -   **routes/**: Define API endpoints and connect them with controllers.
    -   **models/**: Database models (schemas for MongoDB).
    -   **services/**: Business logic that is not directly related to routes (e.g., data processing, third-party services integration).
    -   **middlewares/**: Reusable middleware functions (e.g., authentication, logging).
    -   **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers.
    -   **config/**: Configuration files and environment variable management.
-   **tests/**: Unit and integration tests.
-   **types/**: Custom TypeScript type definitions.

## Separation of Concerns:

-   Separate route handling, business logic, and data access. This makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.

## Scalability:

-   Use asynchronous code to handle I/O-bound operations.
-   Optimize database interactions for efficiency.
-   Implement caching where appropriate.

## Environment Configuration:

-   Store configuration and secrets in environment variables, not in code. Use .env files for local development.

## Docker Integration:

-   Ensure that the Docker setup is optimized for local development and production deployment.
-   Use Docker Compose for local development to orchestrate your Fastify service and MongoDB.
